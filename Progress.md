So far a large part of the progress made on this project was in getting it to a point where it can easily be setup and run(gathering files and fixing docker issues). Environmental Orb runs and is able to login and create Orbs. My personal progress on testing included connecting my own Life X bulb and running an orb showing an Oberlin building. While the orb connected and showed colors, they were often inaccurate, pulsed inconsistently, or changed at the wrong times.
