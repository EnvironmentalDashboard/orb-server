            <h2>What's an Orb?</h2>
            <p>Orbs are a physical means to communicate current rates of electricity and water consumption relative to normal consumption in a particular location.</p>
            <h2>What's the Dashboard?</h2>
            <p>The Environmental Dashboard's goal is to make the invisible flows of water and electricity through communities visible and engaging. By including the voices of community members, we link these resource flows to the thoughts and actions of citizens working to build a more vibrant, resilient and sustainable city. Electronic signs and orbs in community spaces and public schools feature the three central components of the Dashboard, which can all be viewed on <a href="http://environmentaldashboard.org/">our</a> website.</p>
